# Crosscode Mod to make the Ninja-Outfit permanent for Lea +extras
This mod replaces all the non-DLC textures of Lea in her default outfit with her Ninja outfit intead. The extras are that I have taken some of the bits from the default outfit that I personally prefer and combined everything together. The bigget change is that Lea is not wearing the mask with the Ninja Outfit so all her expressions can be seen in full. You also may notice the boots and shoulder pads are not the DLC ones but the default outfit ones.

Not all textures are 100% finished and "production-ready". Currently aprox. 90% of them are finalized however the remaining 10% have been replaced but still need finishing touches

Major requirements to be able to publish a" v1.0" are:-
- Parralax textures for Lea shaded fully and animated accurately 
(currently only the hair is animated on the title screen as its from default outfit, also the shading is less than 10% done)
- All spritesheet textures confirmed to match pose from original spritesheets, correctly colored and demasked
(My goal is to only change the outfit for all the sprites not the actua style or poses themselves.)

Other than that there are some minor tweaks here and there I would like to come back around to as well as need to do a full proper test of the outfit in-game to ensure everything matches up properly. Also I am an absolute beginner at any form of art, so do not expect fast updates, I am still learning and figuring a lot out and my progress whilst steady... is pretty slow.

# Honorable Mentions #
Whilst all assets in this mod are ones that I have worked on, I cannot claim this is an original idea.

The User Fauxless has a similar mod at https://github.com/fauxless/crosscode-ninja-skin-rework

Having his existing work on making the ninja outfit permanent was a huge boon to be able to use something for reference

I also received help  from users in the CrossCode modding discord server itself (and found fauxless' mod through the server).
